## Test callout with title but no body

This tests the fix for issue #13603: callouts with a title but no body content
should render to GitHub Flavored Markdown without crashing.

The issue occurred because the GFM renderer didn't handle the case where
`callout.content` is nil/empty.

::: {.callout-tip}

## Title Only

:::

## Callout with title and body (for comparison)

::: {.callout-note}

## With Body

Content here.
