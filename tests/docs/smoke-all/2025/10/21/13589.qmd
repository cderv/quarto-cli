## Test callout with invalid crossref ID

This tests that callouts with invalid ID prefixes (not matching any known crossref category)
should render with a warning instead of crashing.

::: {#random-id .callout-note}

## Note with invalid ID

This callout uses `#random-id` which has an unknown prefix "random".
The valid prefixes are: fig, tbl, lst, nte, wrn, cau, tip, imp, prf, rem, sol.

This should render successfully with a warning, not crash.
