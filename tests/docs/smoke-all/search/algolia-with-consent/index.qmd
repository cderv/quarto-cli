This test verifies that when `cookie-consent` is configured in the website settings:

1. The Algolia search options JSON contains `"cookie-consent-enabled": true`
2. Algolia Insights scripts are deferred with `type="text/plain" cookie-consent="tracking"`
3. Scripts only execute after user grants "tracking" consent
4. Cookie consent UI elements are present on the page
